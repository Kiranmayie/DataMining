1) Open the project INSE6180
2) Execute main.R File starting with sourceFunctions and then including libraries
3) Load The Data using the LoadData.R
4) Execute the Featuresubsetselection Algorithms using fss_Algorithms.R
5) Then Load the data of Dataset 1 and find the accuracy results of CFS, Relief and FAST
6) Execute the FastAlgorithm.R line by line file to find the Feature to Feature Correlation matrix and T- Relevance Data
7) Repeat the same procedure for Dataset 2
